🤖 **Rule-Based Chatbot**

📖 **Overview**

This project implements a rule-based chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques with NLTK. The chatbot responds to user queries based on predefined patterns and rules.

📂 **Features**

Pattern Matching: Uses regex-based rules to identify user intents.

Predefined Responses: Generates responses based on specific keywords.

Basic Conversation Handling: Greets users, answers common questions, and provides simple interactions.

Reflection Dictionary: Maps pronouns for a more natural conversation flow.

🛠️ **Methodology**

Rule Definition

Defined regex-based patterns for different user queries.

Preprocessing & Reflection Mapping

Utilized reflections to handle variations in user inputs.

Chatbot Engine

Used nltk.chat.util.Chat to match patterns and generate responses.

User Interaction

Designed structured responses for greetings, help requests, and other predefined queries.

📊 **Example Conversations**

User: "Hi"  Chatbot: "Hello! How can I assist you?"

User: "What is your name?"  Chatbot: "My name is the Clever Programmer, but you can call me Robot!"

User: "Bye"  Chatbot: "Goodbye! See you soon."

🚀 **Installation & Usage**

Install dependencies:

pip install nltk

Run the chatbot script:

python chatbot.py

Interact with the chatbot in the terminal.

📌 **Future Improvements**

Enhancing Responses: Expanding rule sets for more realistic conversations.

Machine Learning Integration: Using AI models (e.g., GPT-4) for dynamic responses.

Multilingual Support: Extending to Bengali and other languages.

API Integration: Connecting with databases and external sources for better interactions.

🚀 **Stay tuned for more updates!**
